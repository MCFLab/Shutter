# Welcome to the Shutter Project!

The **Shutter Project** is an open-source development of a low-cost, general purpose shutter system based on ubiquitous actuators (servo motors or solenoids) that are connected to an Arduino-based controller. Several shutters can be controlled by one controller, reducing system cost. The state of the shutters can be controlled via a display built into the controller, by serial commands via USB, or by electrical control lines. The use of a microcontroller makes the shutter controller adaptable â€“ only control options that are used need to be included, and the design accommodates a selection of display and actuator options. We provide designs for all required components, including 3D print files for the actuator holders and cases, software for the Arduino, libraries for serial communication (C and python), and example graphical user interfaces for testing.
